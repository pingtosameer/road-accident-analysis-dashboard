# Road Accident Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accidents through an interactive dashboard. Developed to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, and interactive reporting, this dashboard provides deep insights into road accident statistics, including casualty severity, vehicle types involved, road conditions, and temporal trends.

## Features and Components


### 1. Casualty Overview
- **Visualization**: KPI cards with donut charts
- **Metrics**: Total Casualties, Fatal Casualties, Serious Casualties, Slight Casualties
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Total of 417,883 casualties
  - 1.7% Fatal, 14.2% Serious, 84.1% Slight casualties


### 2. Casualties by Vehicle Type
- **Visualization**: Vertical bar chart
- **Metrics**: Total casualties for each vehicle type
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Cars account for the majority of casualties (333,485)
  - Motorcycles have the second-highest casualty count (33,672)

### 3. Monthly Casualty Trend
- **Visualization**: Line chart
- **Metrics**: Monthly casualty count for current year (CY) vs previous year (PY)
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Seasonal variations in accident rates
  - Comparison between years to identify trends or improvements

### 4. Casualties by Road Type
- **Visualization**: Horizontal bar chart
- **Metrics**: Casualty count by road type
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Single carriageway roads have the highest number of casualties (309.7k)
  - Roundabouts and slip roads have relatively fewer casualties

### 5. Casualties by Road Surface
- **Visualization**: Stacked bar chart
- **Metrics**: Casualty count by road surface condition
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Dry road conditions account for the majority of casualties (279,445)
  - Wet/damp conditions also contribute significantly to casualties
 
### 6. Casualties by Light Condition
- **Visualization**: Donut chart
- **Metrics**: Casualty count by light condition
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Daylight accidents account for 305.0k casualties
  - Darkness-related accidents contribute to 112.9k casualties

### 7. Urban vs Rural Analysis
- **Visualization**: Donut chart
- **Metrics**: Casualty count by urban/rural area
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Urban areas have a higher number of casualties (255.9k) compared to rural areas (162.0k)

## Technical Implementation
- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel
- **Data Processing**: Utilized Excel's data manipulation features for cleaning and structuring the dataset
- **Visualization**: Leveraged Excel's charting capabilities to create dynamic and interactive visualizations
- **Interactivity**: Implemented filters for accident date and urban/rural area selection
- **Layout**: Designed a user-friendly dashboard layout for intuitive navigation and data interpretation

## Key Findings and Business Implications
- **Severity Distribution**: The high percentage of slight casualties (84.1%) suggests that while accidents are common, most are not severe. However, the 1.7% fatal casualties still represent a significant number of lives lost.
- **Vehicle Type Focus**: Cars being involved in the majority of casualties indicates a need for targeted safety measures for passenger vehicles.
- **Road Type Priority**: Single carriageways should be a priority for safety improvements given their high casualty numbers.
- **Urban Safety**: The higher number of casualties in urban areas suggests a need for enhanced urban road safety measures.
- **Seasonal Trends**: The monthly trend analysis can inform when to implement heightened safety campaigns or increased enforcement.
- **Light Condition Impact**: While most accidents occur in daylight, the significant number of dark condition accidents suggests a need for improved night-time road safety measures.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement predictive analytics for accident hotspot identification
- Integrate weather data for more comprehensive analysis
- Develop more granular time-of-day analysis
- Create a dynamic, real-time updating system linked to live accident data
- Expand the analysis to include factors such as driver behavior and vehicle safety features

## How to Use
1. Open the dashboard file using Microsoft Excel
2. Use the date range slider to select the desired time period for analysis
3. Toggle between Urban and Rural areas using the filter panel
4. Hover over chart elements for detailed tooltips and information
5. Analyze the various charts and metrics to gain insights into road accident patterns and trends
